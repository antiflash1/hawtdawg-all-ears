## Where do I list my favorite treats


Open the Hwat Dawg app and click on "Eddit Profile."

Scroll down to the section called "Passions" and tell potential mates and friends all about the terats and toys that mae your tail wag.

When you're done, click "Save Changes" to show the world.


## Photos are nice and all, but I don't see very well. How can I smell the other dogs?


We regret that we are unable to offer our customer smell-o-vision at this time.

As soon as human technologi catches up to dog noses, we'll be sure to add a scent feature to the app.

In the meantime, why not meet up at the dog park to get a whiff of your new friend?
